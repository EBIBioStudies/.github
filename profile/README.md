The [BioStudies database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies) holds descriptions of biological studies, links to data from these studies in other databases at [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) or outside, as well as data that do not fit in the structured archives at EMBL-EBI. The database accepts submissions via an online tool, or in a simple tab-delimited format, PageTab. It also enables authors to submit supplementary information and link to it from the publication.

The main repositories are:

- [Documentation for the PageTab format](https://ebibiostudies.github.io/page-tab-specification/)
- [Frontend](https://github.com/EBIBioStudies/ribs/)
- [Backend](https://github.com/EBIBioStudies/biostudies-backend-services)
- [Submission tool](https://github.com/EBIBioStudies/BioStudyUISub)
- [Notebooks](https://github.com/EBIBioStudies/biostudies-notebooks)
